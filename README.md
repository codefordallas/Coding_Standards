# Github Repository Contributions

All commits must occur on a branch other than master.

Create a feature branch, with a descriptive name, and make commits to it. 

Once the code is ready, open a merge request, and post a link to it in the Discord.
   
Add an @Core Team Admins, to get the attention for review.

If you have problems, first install [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md)

If you still have problems, reach out to someone via our Discord, and someone will help. 

Please update these instructions as required! Happy coding!
